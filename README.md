## Getting Started

Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/senguptaumd/Background-Matting.git
```

Please use Python 3. Create an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) environment and install the dependencies. Our code is tested with Pytorch=1.1.0, Tensorflow=1.14 with cuda10.0

```
conda create --name back-matting python=3.6
conda activate back-matting
```
Install PyTorch, Tensorflow (needed for segmentation) and dependencies

**GPU**
```
conda install pytorch=1.1.0 torchvision cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure CUDA 10.0 is your default cuda. If your CUDA 10.0 is installed in `/usr/local/cuda-10.0`, apply
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.0/lib64
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda-10.0/bin
```

**CPU**
```
conda install pytorch=1.1.0 torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch
conda install tensorflow=1.14.0
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: The code is likely to work on other PyTorch and Tensorflow versions compatible with your system CUDA. If you already have a working environment with PyTorch and Tensorflow, only install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If our code fails due to different versions, then you need to install specific CUDA, PyTorch and Tensorflow versions.

## Run the inference code on sample images

### Data

To perform Background Matting based green-screening, you need to capture:
- (a) Image with the subject (use `_img.png` extension)
- (b) Image of the background without the subject (use `_back.png` extension)
- (c) Target background to insert the subject (place in `data/background`)

Use `sample_data/` folder for testing and prepare your own data based on that. This data was collected with a hand-held camera.

### Pre-trained model

Please download the pre-trained models from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WLDBC_Q-cA72QC8bB-Rdj53UB2vSPnXv?usp=sharing) and place `Models/` folder inside `Background-Matting/`.

Note: `syn-comp-adobe-trainset` model was trained on the training set of the Adobe dataset. This was the model used for numerical evaluation on Adobe dataset.


### Pre-processing

1. Segmentation

Background Matting needs a segmentation mask for the subject. We use tensorflow version of [Deeplabv3+](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab).

```
cd Background-Matting/
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
cd models/research/
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`:`pwd`/slim
cd ../..
python test_segmentation_deeplab.py -i sample_data/input
```

You can replace Deeplabv3+ with any segmentation network of your choice. Save the segmentation results with extension `_masksDL.png`.

2. Alignment

Skip this step, if your data is captured with fixed-camera.

- For hand-held camera, we need to align the background with the input image as a part of pre-processing. We apply simple hoomography based alignment.
- We ask users to **disable the auto-focus and auto-exposure** of the camera while capturing the pair of images. This can be easily done in iPhone cameras (tap and hold for a while).

Run `python test_pre_process.py -i sample_data/input` for pre-processing. It aligns the background image `_back.png` and changes its bias-gain to match the input image `_img.png`

We used AKAZE features python code (since SURF and SIFT unavilable in opencv3) for alignment. We also provide an alternate MATLAB code (`test_pre_process.m`), which uses SURF features. MATLAB code also provides a way to visualize feature matching and alignment. Bad alignment will produce bad matting output.
Bias-gain adjustment is turned off in the Python code due to a bug, but it is present in MATLAB code. If there are significant exposure changes between the captured image and the captured background, use bias-gain adjustment to account for that.

Feel free to write your own alignment code, choose your favorite feature detector, feature matching and alignment.

### Background Matting

```bash
python test_background-matting_image.py -m real-hand-held -i sample_data/input/ -o sample_data/output/ -tb sample_data/background/0001.png
```
For images taken with fixed camera (with a tripod), choose `-m real-fixed-cam` for best results. `-m syn-comp-adobe` lets you use the model trained on synthetic-composite Adobe dataset, without real data (worse performance).

## Run the inference code on sample videos

This is almost exactly similar as that of the image with few small changes.

### Data

To perform Background Matting based green-screening, you need to capture:
- (a) Video with the subject (`teaser.mov`)
- (b) Image of the background without the subject (use `teaser_back.png` extension)
- (c) Target background to insert the subject (place in `target_back.mov`)

We provide `sample_video/` captured with hand-held camera and `sample_video_fixed/` captured with fixed camera for testing. Please [download the data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C_fLlL_WUP7A_ZcdKxbYVcF_T1uy1SRK) and place both folders under `Background-Matting`. Prepare your own data based on that.

### Pre-processing

1. Frame extraction:

```
cd Background-Matting/sample_video
mkdir input background
ffmpeg -i teaser.mov input/%04d_img.png -hide_banner
ffmpeg -i target_back.mov background/%04d.png -hide_banner
```

Repeat the same for `sample_video_fixed`

2. Segmentation
```
cd Background-Matting/models/research/
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`:`pwd`/slim
cd ../..
python test_segmentation_deeplab.py -i sample_video/input
```

Repeat the same for `sample_video_fixed`

3. Alignment

No need to run alignment for `sample_video_fixed` or videos captured with fixed-camera.

Run `python test_pre_process_video.py -i sample_video/input -v_name sample_video/teaser_back.png` for pre-processing. Alternately you can also use `test_pre_process_video.m` in MATLAB.

### Background Matting

For hand-held videos, like `sample_video`:

```bash
python test_background-matting_image.py -m real-hand-held -i sample_video/input/ -o sample_video/output/ -tb sample_video/background/
```

For fixed-camera videos, like `sample_video_fixed`:

```bash
python test_background-matting_image.py -m real-fixed-cam -i sample_video_fixed/input/ -o sample_video_fixed/output/ -tb sample_video_fixed/background/ -b sample_video_fixed/teaser_back.png
```

To obtain the video from the output frames, run:
```
cd Background-Matting/sample_video
ffmpeg -r 60 -f image2 -i output/%04d_matte.png -vcodec libx264 -crf 15 -s 1280x720 -pix_fmt yuv420p teaser_matte.mp4
ffmpeg -r 60 -f image2 -i output/%04d_compose.png -vcodec libx264 -crf 15 -s 1280x720 -pix_fmt yuv420p teaser_compose.mp4
```

Repeat same for `sample_video_fixed`

## Notes on capturing images

For best results capture images following these guidelines:
- Choose a background that is mostly static, can be both indoor and outdoor.
- Avoid casting any shadows of the subject on the background.
	- place the subject atleast few feets away from the background.
	- if possible adjust the lighting to avoid strong shadows on the background.
- Avoid large color coincidences between subject and background. (e.g. Do not wear a white shirt in front of a white wall background.)
- Lock AE/AF (Auto-exposure and Auto-focus) of the camera.
- For hand-held capture, you need to:
	- allow only small camera motion by continuing to holding the camera as the subject exists the scene.
	- avoid backgrounds that has two perpendicular planes (homography based alignment will fail) or use a background very far away.
	- The above restirctions do not apply for images captured with fixed camera (on a tripod)



## Training on synthetic-composite Adobe dataset ##

### Data ###

- Download original Adobe matting dataset: [Follow instructions.](https://sites.google.com/view/deepimagematting)
- Separate human images: Use `test_data_list.txt` and `train_data_list.txt` in `Data_adobe` to copy only human subjects from Adobe dataset. Create folders `fg_train`, `fg_test`, `mask_train`, `mask_test` to copy foreground and alpha matte for test and train data separately. (The train test split is same as the original dataset.) You can run the following to accomplish this:
```bash
cd Data_adobe
./prepare.sh /path/to/adobe/Combined_Dataset
```
- Download background images: Download MS-COCO images and place it in [`bg_train`](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/test2017.zip) and in [`bg_test`](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip).
- Compose Adobe foregrounds onto COCO for the train and test sets. This saves the composed result as `_comp` and the background as `_back` under `merged_train` and `merged_test`. It will also create a CSV to be used by the training dataloader. You can pass `--workers 8` to use e.g. 8 threads, though it will use only one by default.
```bash
python compose.py --fg_path fg_train --mask_path mask_train --bg_path bg_train --out_path merged_train --out_csv Adobe_train_data.csv
python compose.py --fg_path fg_test --mask_path mask_test --bg_path bg_test --out_path merged_test
```


### Training ###

Change number of GPU and required batch-size, depending on your platform. We trained the model with 512x512 input (`-res` flag).

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python train_adobe.py -n Adobe_train -bs 4 -res 512
```

Notes:
- 512x512 is the maximum input resolution we recommend for training
- If you decreasing training resolution to 256x256, change `-res 256`, but we also recommend using lesser residual blocks. Use: `-n_blocks1 5 -n_blocks2 2`.

## Training on unlabeled real videos ##

### Data ###

[Please download our captured videos.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j3BMrRFhFpfzJAe6P2WDtfanoeSCLPiq?usp=sharing). We will show next how to finetune your model on `fixed-camera` captured videos. It will be similar for `hand-held` cameras, except you will need to align the captured background image to each frame of the video separately. (Take a hint from `test_pre_process.py` and use `alignImages()`.)

Data Pre-processing:
- Extract frames for each video: `ffmpeg -i $NAME.mp4 $NAME/%04d_img.png -hide_banner`
- Run Segmentation (follow instructions on Deeplabv3+) : `python test_segmentation_deeplab.py -i $NAME`
- Target background for composition. For self-supervised learning we need some target backgrounds that has roughly similar lighting as the original videos. Either capture few videos of indoor/outdoor scenes without humans or use our captured background in the `background` folder.
- Create a .csv file `Video_data_train.csv` with each row as: `$image;$captured_back;$segmentation;$image+20frames;$image+2*20frames;$image+3*20frames;$image+4*20frames;$target_back`.
The process is automated by `prepare_real.py` -- take a look inside and change `background_path` and `path` before running.

### Training ###

Change number of GPU and required batch-size, depending on your platform. We trained the model with 512x512 input (`-res` flag).

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python train_real_fixed.py -n Real_fixed -bs 4 -res 512 -init_model Models/syn-comp-adobe-trainset/net_epoch_64.pth
```
